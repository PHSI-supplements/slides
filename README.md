## Coming Summer 2021!

I'm scrubbing my slides to make sure I'm not sharing anything that isn't mine
to share. I expect this process to be complete by the end of June 2021. I'll
add the slidedecks to the repository as the process progresses.

After I've finished with the slides, I'll transcribe my hand-written pages (and
pages and pages) of worked examples for use during lecture and/or recitation.

This repository will contain lecture slides to enhance your use of the
[*Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface*](https://www.greatriverlearning.com/product-details/1846)
textbook by Christopher A. Bohn.

The slides `chap01.pptx`, `chap02.pptx`, ..., `chap12.pptx` correspond to the
chapters in the publication. If you are looking for lecture slides covering the
topics in chapter *NN*, you will find them in the `chapNN.pptx` file. Note
that, just as chapters 8 and 11 are divided into two parts each, the slides for
these topics are divided into `chapNNa.pptx` and `chapNNb.pptx` to facilitate
re-ordering of subject material based on how you wish to conduct your course.

If you have not adopted
[*Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface*](https://www.greatriverlearning.com/product-details/1846)
for your course, please consider doing so.
