## Coming Summer 2021!

(after I finish scrubbing my slides to make sure I'm not sharing anything that
isn't mine to share)

This repository will contain lecture slides to enhance your use of the
[*Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface*](https://www.greatriverlearning.com/product-details/1846)
textbook by Christopher A. Bohn.

The slides `chap01.pptx`, `chap02.pptx`, ..., `chap12.pptx` correspond to the
chapters in the publication. If you are looking for lecture slides covering the
topics in chapter *NN*, you will find them in the `chapNN.pptx` file. Note
that, just as chapters 8 and 11 are divided into two parts each, the slides for
these topics are divided into `chapNNa.pptx` and `chapNNb.pptx` to facilitate
re-ordering of subject material based on how you wish to conduct your course.

If you have not adopted
[*Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface*](https://www.greatriverlearning.com/product-details/1846)
for your course, please consider doing so.
