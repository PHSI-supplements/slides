# Slides

I'm scrubbing my chapters 10 & 12 slides to make sure I'm not sharing anything
that isn't mine to share. I this process will be complete soon. I also plan to
make continuous tweaks to the slides if I try a different approach to a topic
and decide that the new approach works better. I'll add the slidedecks to the
repository as the process progresses.

This repository contains lecture slides and worked examples to enhance your use
of the [*Programming at the Hardware/Software
Interface*](https://www.greatriverlearning.com/product-details/1846) textbook by
Christopher A. Bohn.

The slides `chap01.pptx`, `chap02.pptx`, ..., `chap12.pptx` correspond to the
chapters in the publication. If you are looking for lecture slides covering the
topics in chapter *NN*, you will find them in the `chapNN.pptx` file.

Note that, just as chapters 8 and 11 are divided into two parts each, the
slides for these topics are divided into `chapNNa.pptx` and `chapNNb.pptx` to
facilitate re-ordering of subject material based on how you wish to conduct
your course. For example, I like to cover the first half of chapter 11, buffer
overflow, immediately after covering chapter 6, which covers the assembly code
view of arrays, the program stack, and procedure calls/returns (among other
material), but the second half of chapter 11, side-channel attacks, really
needs to wait until after the second half of chapter 8 (for branch prediction
and for an explanation of out-of-order engines) and after chapter 10 so that
students are more familiar with caches. On the other hand, you might prefer to
cover the entirety of chapter 11, with its singular focus on security issues, as
a contiguous lesson.

If you have not adopted
[*Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface*](https://www.greatriverlearning.com/product-details/1846)
for your course, please consider doing so.
